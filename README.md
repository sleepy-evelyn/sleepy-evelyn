### Welcome fellow nosey personðŸ”­

I code and play bass sometimes. I also make Minecraft mods because why not, it's fun.
  
- Brute forced my way into programming through the power of _âœ¨practiceâœ¨_.
- I have lots of ideas for things... Most of which don't get done
- Languages I know well: Java, C/Modern C++
- Additional languages I have used: Swift, Python, PHP, C#

<sub>Note to employers, I don't keep private work on my Github normally. This includes ventures into audio programming, university work etc...</sub>
